# Weather App
A `weather app` that allows users to search for the current weather information of a location by entering its name in the search box. 
The app uses the `OpenWeather API` to retrieve weather data for the entered location and displays it on the app's interface.

## Getting Started
To use this app, you need to have Python installed on your system along with the following packages:

- tkinter
- geopy
- timezonefinder
- requests
- pytz
- dotenv

To retrieve the weather data, you also need to have an `API key` from OpenWeather. 
The API key is stored in a `.env` file and is accessed using the `dotenv` package.

## How to Use
1. Download all the files in the repository and save them in the same folder.
2. Open the terminal/command prompt in the folder where the files are saved.
3. Run the command `python weather.py` to launch the app.
4. Enter the name of the location in the search box and click on the search icon or press the Enter key.
5. The app will display the current weather information for the entered location.

## Important Notes
- Do not expose your API key to the public by including it in the code or uploading it to GitHub.
- Ensure that the downloaded images and the code file are saved in the same folder.
- Otherwise, you may need to update the file paths in the code.
- In case of any errors, an error message will be displayed in a message box.
